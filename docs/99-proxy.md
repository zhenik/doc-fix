# Proxy

If you for any reason find yourself behind a transparent proxy you need to set the environment variables `SSL_CERT_FILE` and `CURL_CA_BUNDLE`. You have three options:
- Prefix `vagrant up`; `SSL_CERT_FILE=<path/to/ca-certificates-file> CURL_CA_BUNDLE=<path/to/ca-certificates-file> vagrant up`
- Set the environment variables in your current session by running `export SSL_CERT_FILE=<path/to/ca-certificates-file>` and `export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=<path/to/ca-certificates-file>` in the terminal. Eg:`export SSL_CERT_FILE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt CURL_CA_BUNDLE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`
- Set the environment variables permanently by adding the export commands above to your `~/.bashrc` or equivalent.
